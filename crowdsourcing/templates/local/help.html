        <h2>Navigation on the image</h2>
        <p>To navigate around the image, you can zoom in and out with the mouse wheel<br> To move around: hold the left-click pressed outside of a rectangle box.</p>

        <h2>How to transcript</h2>
        <p>The first step in transcription is to label each line separately to allow the work to be segmented and help ia learning. Once you have created a few rectangles, click on the submit rectangle button (bottom left) to save the rectangles and add the corresponding text boxes.
            Once the rectangles have been saved (rectangles will turn blue), you can transcribe each rectangle in the corresponding text zone on the right part.
            When you have finished, you can either save your progress or finish transcribing to send the document to the verification phase.
            <br>
            <strong>Important: always follow the following order 1) create the rectangle 2) save the rectangles 3) transcribe the sentences 4)save the progress, so as not to lose any progress.
            <br> When you start a task, you are (for the moment) obliged to finish it. If you just want to abandon the task, you can simply finish the step with no rectangle. (I will manually clean it)</strong>

        <h2>Verification part</h2>
        For verification, the verifier can do 4 things for each rectangle :
        <ul>

            <li>Do nothing: this means that he accepts the transcription. This rectangle will be validated and can no longer be modified.</li>
            <li>Delete the rectangle: permanently delete the rectangle if it does not correspond to a line</li>
            <li>Edit the text: by clicking on the pencil, the checker can propose another transcription. This step will require a 2nd check.</li>
            <li>Access the forum: by clicking on the icon, the user can access or create a forum linked to this rectangle or document.</li>
        </ul>
        The checker can save their progress or finish the check to complete the task.
